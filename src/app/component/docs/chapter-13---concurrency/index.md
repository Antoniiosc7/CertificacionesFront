The concurrency chapter from the "OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 17 Developer Study Guide" covers several important topics related to managing concurrent code execution. Here's a summary of the key points along with detailed examples and explanations provided in the chapter:

### Key Topics Covered:

1. **Managing Concurrent Code Execution**:
  - Creating worker threads using `Runnable` and `Callable`.
  - Managing the thread lifecycle, including automation provided by different Executor services and the concurrent API.
  - Developing thread-safe code using different locking mechanisms and the concurrent API.
  - Processing Java collections concurrently, including the use of parallel streams.

2. **Threads and Processes**:
  - **Thread**: The smallest unit of execution that can be scheduled by the operating system.
  - **Process**: A group of associated threads that execute in the same shared environment.
  - Single-threaded process vs. Multi-threaded process.

3. **Concurrency API**:
  - **ExecutorService**: A higher-level replacement for working with threads directly. Different types include single-threaded, fixed-thread pool, cached thread pool, and scheduled thread pool.
  - **Callable vs. Runnable**: `Callable` returns a result and can throw a checked exception, whereas `Runnable` does not return a result and cannot throw checked exceptions.
  - **Future**: Represents the result of an asynchronous computation. Methods include `get()`, `isDone()`, and `cancel()`.

4. **Synchronization Mechanisms**:
  - **Synchronized Blocks/Methods**: Ensures that only one thread executes a particular section of code at a time.
  - **ReentrantLock**: A more flexible option compared to synchronized blocks, allowing more complex thread interaction patterns.
  - **Atomic Variables**: Provides lock-free thread-safe programming on single variables.

5. **Thread Safety and Liveness Issues**:
  - **Thread Safety**: Protecting shared data from concurrent access.
  - **Liveness Issues**: Problems such as deadlock, starvation, and livelock where threads are unable to make progress.

6. **Concurrent Collections**:
  - Classes like `ConcurrentHashMap` and `CopyOnWriteArrayList` which handle multithreaded access automatically.

7. **Parallel Streams**:
  - Using parallel streams for data processing to leverage multi-core processors, ensuring thread safety and avoiding stateful operations for accurate results.

### Examples and Explanations:

1. **Creating Worker Threads**:
    ```java
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
    executor.submit(() -> {
        // task implementation
    });
    executor.shutdown();
    ```

2. **Using `Callable` and `Future`**:
    ```java
    Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
        return 123;
    };
    Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);
    Integer result = future.get();  // waits for the task to complete and returns the result
    ```

3. **Synchronization with ReentrantLock**:
    ```java
    ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    lock.lock();
    try {
        // critical section
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
    ```

4. **Using Atomic Variables**:
    ```java
    AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
    count.incrementAndGet();  // thread-safe increment
    ```

5. **Avoiding Liveness Issues**:
  - **Deadlock**: Occurs when two or more threads are waiting on each other to release resources.
  - **Starvation**: A thread is perpetually denied access to resources.
  - **Livelock**: Two threads repeatedly block each other from making progress.

6. **Parallel Streams**:
    ```java
    List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    list.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);
    ```

Understanding and applying these concurrency concepts is essential for developing efficient and reliable Java applications. The chapter provides a comprehensive guide for both exam preparation and practical software development.
