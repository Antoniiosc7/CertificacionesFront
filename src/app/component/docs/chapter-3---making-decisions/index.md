The "OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 17 Developer Study Guide: Exam 1Z0-829" covers key concepts necessary for the OCP certification. Below is a summary of various Java features and their implementations:

### Java Concurrency and Liveness Issues
- **Concurrency API**: Helps eliminate threading issues by managing thread interactions, often in just a few lines of code.
- **Liveness Problems**: Issues like deadlock, starvation, and livelock, where the application becomes unresponsive or stuck due to threads waiting indefinitely.
  - **Deadlock**: Occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting on the other.
    ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.*;

    class Food {}
    class Water {}

    public record Fox(String name) {
       public void eatAndDrink(Food food, Water water) {
          synchronized(food) {
             System.out.println(name() + " Got Food!");
             move();
             synchronized(water) {
                System.out.println(name() + " Got Water!");
             }
          }
       }
       public void drinkAndEat(Food food, Water water) {
          synchronized(water) {
             System.out.println(name() + " Got Water!");
             move();
             synchronized(food) {
                System.out.println(name() + " Got Food!");
             }
          }
       }
       public void move() {
          try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
       }
       public static void main(String[] args) {
          var foxy = new Fox("Foxy");
          var tails = new Fox("Tails");
          var food = new Food();
          var water = new Water();
          var service = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(10);
          try {
             service.submit(() -> foxy.eatAndDrink(food, water));
             service.submit(() -> tails.drinkAndEat(food, water));
          } finally {
             service.shutdown();
          }
       }
    }
    ```

### Abstract Classes and Methods
- **Invalid Declarations**: Common mistakes include defining abstract methods with implementations or without a semicolon.
  - Examples of non-compiling methods:
    ```java
    public abstract class Turtle {
       public abstract long eat()      // DOES NOT COMPILE
       public abstract void swim() {}; // DOES NOT COMPILE
       public abstract int getAge() {  // DOES NOT COMPILE
          return 10;
       }
       public abstract void sleep;     // DOES NOT COMPILE
       public void goInShell();        // DOES NOT COMPILE
    }
    ```

### Access Modifiers and Method Declarations
- **Default Method Access**: The `default` keyword cannot be used as an access modifier. Correct declaration must place access modifiers before the return type.
  - Examples of compiling and non-compiling methods:
    ```java
    public class ParkTrip {
       public void skip1() {}
       default void skip2() {} // DOES NOT COMPILE
       void public skip3() {}  // DOES NOT COMPILE
       void skip4() {}
    }
    ```

### Optional Specifiers
- **Specifiers**: Static, abstract, final, synchronized, native, and strictfp. These must appear before the return type in a method declaration.
  - Valid method declarations:
    ```java
    public class Exercise {
       public void bike1() {}
       public final void bike2() {}
       public static final void bike3() {}
       public final static void bike4() {}
       public modifier void bike5() {}       // DOES NOT COMPILE
       public void final bike6() {}          // DOES NOT COMPILE
       final public void bike7() {}
    }
    ```

These examples provide a clear understanding of critical Java concepts and common pitfalls, essential for passing the OCP Java SE 17 Developer exam    .
